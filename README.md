## Project Overview

The Custom T-Shirt Hub is a web application that allows users to design custom t-shirts through a guided, theme-based design flow. Users can select themes, answer questions to customize their design, and use a visual editor to make final adjustments before ordering.

## Current Status

The project has implemented core authentication and design functionality but requires security improvements and feature completion before it can be considered production-ready. See the [Project Status](./project_status.md) document for detailed information.

## Security Status

Several critical security issues have been identified and need to be addressed, particularly:

1. Authentication tokens stored in localStorage (XSS vulnerability)
2. Unscoped API queries
3. Lack of input sanitization
4. Missing security headers
5. No rate limiting on sensitive endpoints

See the [Security Checklist](./security_checklist_updated.md) for a detailed breakdown of security concerns and recommendations.

## Next Steps

The immediate focus should be on addressing the critical security issues identified in the security checklist, followed by completing the user dashboard and checkout flow. See the [Project Status](./project_status.md) document for detailed next steps.
