# 🔐 **Codebase Security Checklist – Custom T-shirt Design App**

*Last Updated: May 2024*

## ✅ **1. Authentication & Authorization**
- ✅ **Implemented:** Supabase Auth configured with email domain restrictions or email confirmations if needed.
- ✅ **Implemented:** JWT tokens are validated on both client and server (e.g., during Supabase Function calls).
- ✅ **Implemented:** Authentication tokens are stored in **HttpOnly cookies** with secure configuration (secure: true, sameSite: 'strict'), protecting against XSS attacks.
- ✅ **Implemented:** Role-based UI logic matches Supabase RLS policies to avoid privilege escalation on the frontend.

---

## 📦 **2. API & Data Layer (Supabase)**
- ✅ **Implemented:** RLS policies are thoroughly tested for:
  - Unauthorized read/write protection.
  - Authenticated-only access.
  - Design ownership for user-saved designs and orders.
- ✅ **Implemented:** Supabase storage buckets set to **private** unless explicitly public (e.g., preview images).
- ✅ **Implemented:** API calls via Supabase client are scoped to the **minimum necessary fields**.
- ✅ **Implemented:** Unscoped `select *` queries replaced with explicit column selects across client and edge functions.

---

## 🛡️ **3. Input Validation & Forms**
- ✅ **Implemented:** Zod schemas are implemented for **every form and user input**, both client-side and serverless functions.
- ❌ **Security Issue:** Validation errors may leak technical details (stack traces, etc.).
- ❌ **Not Implemented:** Image uploads (e.g., custom designs) are not validated for MIME type and size.

---

## 🎨 **4. Canvas & Design Editor**
- ✅ **Implemented (partial):** Inputs used in design payloads (answers, name, color, prompt) are sanitized before storage/processing. Remaining: deep canvas content sanitization and file export review.
- ❌ **Security Issue:** File export logic (e.g., downloading .png/.svg) may leak user-specific data.
- ✅ **Implemented:** No access to other users' designs via predictable file paths or IDs.

---

## 🧩 **5. Frontend Code Practices**
- ✅ **Implemented:** Sensitive keys are injected via environment variables (`VITE_PUBLIC_` if needed).
- ❌ **Not Implemented:** React Query responses are sanitized before being rendered in UI. (Planned: sanitize on render for any user-generated strings)
- ❌ **Not Implemented:** No exposure of internal error messages in production (use `console.error` + toast fallback).
- ✅ **Implemented:** All modals/popups (Radix UI) respect focus trap and escape behavior (for accessibility and security).

---

## 🧪 **6. Testing & Static Analysis**
- ✅ **Implemented:** ESLint + Prettier + TypeScript in CI/CD to catch unsafe patterns.
- ❌ **Not Implemented:** No comprehensive test coverage for:
  - Auth flows
  - Design save/export
  - Role-based access in UI
- ❌ **Not Implemented:** No static security scanning of frontend code (e.g., Semgrep).

---

## 🔑 **7. CI/CD & Environment Config**
- ✅ **Implemented:** No API keys or secrets pushed to Git (check with `git-secrets` or similar).
- ✅ **Implemented:** `.env` files ignored via `.gitignore`.
- ✅ **Implemented:** Vercel/Netlify environment variables scoped to project and team.
- ❌ **Not Implemented:** Supabase service roles are not limited to specific use cases (e.g., admin dashboard).

---

## 🌐 **8. Browser-Side Protections**
- ✅ **Implemented:** Production security headers configured via vercel.json (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy) and environment-aware CSP in src/lib/security.ts. Dev remains permissive for Vite.
- ✅ **Implemented:** Rate limiting added to sensitive Supabase Edge Functions (PhonePe initiate/verify, AI generation).
- ✅ **Implemented:** CORS policies aligned to https://merekapade.com in production; localhost in dev.

---

## 🧾 **9. Miscellaneous**
- ❌ **Security Issue:** User input may be rendered directly without proper escaping, creating XSS risk.
- ✅ **Implemented:** Unused permissions and endpoints removed.
- ✅ **Implemented:** Designs and orders are associated with authenticated user IDs, verified before action.

---

## 🔭 **10. Optional Enhancements**
- ❌ **Not Implemented:** No anomaly detection for security events (e.g., multiple failed logins).
- ❌ **Not Implemented:** No additional security middleware like Helmet.
- ❌ **Not Implemented:** No monitoring or logging for suspicious activities.

---

## Summary of Security Implementation Status

### Implemented (12/30)
- Authentication with Supabase

- Anomaly detection and monitoring

## Security Recommendations (Prioritized)

### High Priority (Critical Issues)
1. ✅ Implement proper input sanitization for critical flows (done) — expand to canvas/file export
2. ✅ Scope API queries to only return necessary fields (done)
3. **Add validation for file uploads** to prevent malicious file uploads
4. ✅ Implement security headers to improve browser-side protection (done)

### Medium Priority
6. ✅ Add rate limiting for sensitive endpoints like authentication (done for payment/AI functions)
7. Improve error handling to prevent leaking technical details
8. ✅ Implement CORS policies for cross-origin requests (done)
9. Add sanitization for Canvas inputs and file exports

### Low Priority
10. Set up monitoring and alerting for suspicious activities
11. Implement anomaly detection for security events
12. Add comprehensive security testing
13. Limit Supabase service roles to specific use cases
