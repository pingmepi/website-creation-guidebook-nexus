# 🔐 **Codebase Security Checklist – Custom T-shirt Design App**

*Last Updated: May 2024*

## ✅ **1. Authentication & Authorization**
- ✅ **Implemented:** Supabase Auth configured with email domain restrictions or email confirmations if needed.
- ✅ **Implemented:** JWT tokens are validated on both client and server (e.g., during Supabase Function calls).
- ✅ **Implemented:** Authentication tokens are stored in **HttpOnly cookies** with secure configuration (secure: true, sameSite: 'strict'), protecting against XSS attacks.
- ✅ **Implemented:** Role-based UI logic matches Supabase RLS policies to avoid privilege escalation on the frontend.

---

## 📦 **2. API & Data Layer (Supabase)**
- ✅ **Implemented:** RLS policies are thoroughly tested for:
  - Unauthorized read/write protection.
  - Authenticated-only access.
  - Design ownership for user-saved designs and orders.
- ✅ **Implemented:** Supabase storage buckets set to **private** unless explicitly public (e.g., preview images).
- ❌ **Security Issue:** API calls via Supabase client are not scoped to the **minimum necessary tables/fields**.
- ❌ **Security Issue:** Unscoped `select *` queries are used in production, potentially exposing unnecessary data.

---

## 🛡️ **3. Input Validation & Forms**
- ✅ **Implemented:** Zod schemas are implemented for **every form and user input**, both client-side and serverless functions.
- ❌ **Security Issue:** Validation errors may leak technical details (stack traces, etc.).
- ❌ **Not Implemented:** Image uploads (e.g., custom designs) are not validated for MIME type and size.

---

## 🎨 **4. Canvas & Design Editor**
- ❌ **Security Issue:** Input to the Canvas (e.g., text, images) is not sanitized to prevent injection or DoS attacks.
- ❌ **Security Issue:** File export logic (e.g., downloading .png/.svg) may leak user-specific data.
- ✅ **Implemented:** No access to other users' designs via predictable file paths or IDs.

---

## 🧩 **5. Frontend Code Practices**
- ✅ **Implemented:** Sensitive keys are injected via environment variables (`VITE_PUBLIC_` if needed).
- ❌ **Not Implemented:** React Query responses are sanitized before being rendered in UI.
- ❌ **Not Implemented:** No exposure of internal error messages in production (use `console.error` + toast fallback).
- ✅ **Implemented:** All modals/popups (Radix UI) respect focus trap and escape behavior (for accessibility and security).

---

## 🧪 **6. Testing & Static Analysis**
- ✅ **Implemented:** ESLint + Prettier + TypeScript in CI/CD to catch unsafe patterns.
- ❌ **Not Implemented:** No comprehensive test coverage for:
  - Auth flows
  - Design save/export
  - Role-based access in UI
- ❌ **Not Implemented:** No static security scanning of frontend code (e.g., Semgrep).

---

## 🔑 **7. CI/CD & Environment Config**
- ✅ **Implemented:** No API keys or secrets pushed to Git (check with `git-secrets` or similar).
- ✅ **Implemented:** `.env` files ignored via `.gitignore`.
- ✅ **Implemented:** Vercel/Netlify environment variables scoped to project and team.
- ❌ **Not Implemented:** Supabase service roles are not limited to specific use cases (e.g., admin dashboard).

---

## 🌐 **8. Browser-Side Protections**
- ❌ **Security Issue:** Missing secure headers in application:
  - `Content-Security-Policy`
  - `Strict-Transport-Security`
  - `X-Frame-Options`
  - `Referrer-Policy`
- ❌ **Security Issue:** No rate-limiting on sensitive endpoints, making them vulnerable to brute force attacks.
- ❌ **Not Implemented:** CORS policies are not tightened for cross-origin requests.

---

## 🧾 **9. Miscellaneous**
- ❌ **Security Issue:** User input may be rendered directly without proper escaping, creating XSS risk.
- ✅ **Implemented:** Unused permissions and endpoints removed.
- ✅ **Implemented:** Designs and orders are associated with authenticated user IDs, verified before action.

---

## 🔭 **10. Optional Enhancements**
- ❌ **Not Implemented:** No anomaly detection for security events (e.g., multiple failed logins).
- ❌ **Not Implemented:** No additional security middleware like Helmet.
- ❌ **Not Implemented:** No monitoring or logging for suspicious activities.

---

## Security Recommendations (Prioritized)

### High Priority (Critical Issues)
1. **Implement proper input sanitization** for all user inputs to prevent XSS and injection attacks
2. **Scope API queries** to only return necessary fields instead of using `select *`
3. **Add validation for file uploads** to prevent malicious file uploads
4. **Implement security headers** to improve browser-side protection

### Medium Priority
6. Add rate limiting for sensitive endpoints like authentication
7. Improve error handling to prevent leaking technical details
8. Implement CORS policies for cross-origin requests
9. Add sanitization for Canvas inputs and file exports

### Low Priority
10. Set up monitoring and alerting for suspicious activities
11. Implement anomaly detection for security events
12. Add comprehensive security testing
13. Limit Supabase service roles to specific use cases
